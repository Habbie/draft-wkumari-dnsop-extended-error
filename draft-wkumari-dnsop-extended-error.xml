    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an extensible method to return additional
      information about the cause of DNS errors. The primary expected use for
      this is to extend SERVFAIL to provide more information about the cause
      of DNSSEC failures, but it can be used to annotate many DNS errors.</t>

      <t>[ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background
      information, answers to freqently asked questions, general musings, etc.
      They will be removed before publication.]</t>

      <t>[ This document is being collaborated on in Github at:
      https://github.com/wkumari/&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;. The most recent version of
      the document, open issues, etc should all be available here. The authors
      (gratefully) acept pull requests ]</t>

      <t>[ Note: I always have a hard time with EDNS terminology - I'm saying
      that Extended DNS Errors are carried as EDNS Options, but is this
      actually correct terminology? They are optional TLVs in "options" in
      RDATA in OPTion RR , but that's not readable. ]</t>

    <section title="Introduction and background">
      <t>There are many reasons that a DNS query may fail, some of them
      transient, some permenant; some can be resolved by querying another
      server, some (e.g DNSSEC bogus) are best handled by stopping resolution.
      The range of errors that DNS servers can return are very limited, and
      are not very expressive. This means that applications and resolvers
      often have to "guess" at what the issue is - e.g is a REFUSED because
      there is a lame delegation, it is a DNSSEC vailidation issue, or is the
      nameserver experiancing a bad day? </t>

      <t>A good exampe of issues caused by this is DNSSEC validation issues.
      When a user attempts to resolver a DNSSEC bogus name (using a validating
      resolver), their machine receives a SERVFAIL response. Unfortunaty,
      SERVFAIL is used to signal may sorts of DNS errors, and so their machine
      / stub resolver simply asks the next configured DNS resolver. This may
      result in two outcomes, either the next resolver does not validate, in
      which case the user resolves the name (defeating the protection provided
      by DNSSEC), or it does, and they get a failure that is largely
      incomprehensible to the average user.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to extend (or annotate) DNS
      errors to provide additional information about the cause of the error.
      This information can be used by the resolver to make a decision to retry
      or not, or by users attempting to debug issues.</t>

      <t>Here is a reference to an "external" (non-RFC / draft) thing: (<xref
      target="IANA.AS_Numbers"/>). And this is a link to an ID:<xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sidr-iana-objects"/>.</t>

          <t>OPTION-CODE, 2 octets (Defined in [RFC6891]), for ExtError is
          TBD.</t>

          <t>OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets ((Defined in [RFC6891]) contains the

      <t>Currently the only defined flag is the R flag. <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="R - Retry">The R (or Retry) flag provides a hint to the
          receiver if it should retry the query, possiably by querying another
          server. If the R bit is set (1), the sender believes that retrying
          the query may provide a sucessful answer, if the R bit is clear (0),
          the sender believes that it should not ask another resolver. </t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The remaining bits in the flags field MUST be set to 0 by the sender
      and MUST be ignored by the receiver. </t>

      <t>Code: A code point into the IANA "Extended DNS Errors" registry.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use of the Extended DNS Error option">
      <t>The Extended DNS Error is an EDNS option. It can be included in any
      error response to a query that includes an EDNS option - SERVFAIL,
      NXDOMAIN, REFUSED, etc. This document includes a set of initial
      codepoints (and requests to the IANA to add them to the registry), but
      is extensible to allow additional error codes to be defined. </t>

      <t>The R (Retry) flag provides a hint (or suggestion) as to what the
      receiver may want to do with this annotated error. The mechanism is
      specifically designed to be extensible, and so implementations may
      receive EDE codes that it does not understand. The R flag allows
      implmentations to make a decision as to what to do if it receives a
      response with an unknown code - retry or drop the query. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Defined Extended DNS Errors">
      <t>This document defines some initial EDE codes. The mechanism is
      intended to be extensible, and additional codepoint will be registered
      in the "Extended DNS Errors" registry.</t>

      <section title="Extended DNS Error Code 1 - DNSSEC Bogus">
        <t>The resolver attemped to perform DNSSEC validation, but validation
        ended in the Bogus state. </t>

        <t>Usually attached to SERVFAIL messages. The R flag SHOUD be set.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Extended DNS Error Code 2 - DNSSEC Indeterminite">
        <t>The resolver attemped to perform DNSSEC validation, but validation
        ended in the Indeterminite state.</t>

        <t>Usually attached to SERVFAIL messages. The R flag SHOUD be set.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Extended DNS Error Code 3 - Lame">
        <t>An authorative resolver that receives a query (with the RD bit
        clear) for a domain for which it is not authorative SHOULD include
        this EDE code in the REFUSED response. </t>

        <t>Implementations SHOULD NOT set the R flag in this case.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Extended DNS Error Code 4 - Prohibited">
        <t>An authorative or recursive resolver that receives a query from an
        "unauthorized" client can annotate its REFUSED message with this code.
        Examples of "unauthorized" clients are recursive queries from IP
        addresses outside the network, blacklisted IP addresses, etc. </t>

        <t>Implementations SHOULD allow operators to define what to set the R
        flag to in this case.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Extended DNS Error Code 5 - Ratelimited">
        <t>[ Ed: This might be a horrendous idea. Anyone who is on a position
        where they can do a "cache poisoning" type attach could also insert
        one of these, and turn this into a DoS. Straw</t>

        <t>A nameserver which is under excessive load (for example, because it
        is experiancing a DoS) may annotate any error with this code. </t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementations set the R flag in this case,
        but may allow operators to define what to set the R flag to. </t>
